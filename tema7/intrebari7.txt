The default HTTP method when submitting form data is GET.

However, when GET is used, the form data will be visible in the page's address field:

GET
The method attribute of the form element tells the web browser how to send form data to a server.
 Specifying a value of GET means the browser will add the form contents to the end of the URL. 
 This offers a number of advantages for simple forms.
  It allows the browser to cache the results of the form submission, 
  and it also allows the user to bookmark the page once the form has been submitted.
   As such, GET is generally used for simple forms where security is not a concern.

Restrictions of GET
GET results in the entire contents of the submission being visible in the URL. 
If your form contains sensitive data, you should specify a value of POST for the method attribute. 
Since GET appends the form data to the current URL, it can only be used where the contents of the submission 
(including the complete URL) will result in a string that is 2048 characters long, or less.
 This is the maximum length of a URL. GET can only be used to send ASCII data.

<form method=”POST”>
The method attribute of the form element tells the web browser how to send form data to a server. 
Specifying a value of POST means the browser will send the data to the web server to be processed.
 This is necessary when adding data to a database, or when submitting sensitive information, such as passwords.

Restrictions of POST
When data is sent using POST, submitting the form twice will result in a duplicated entry. 
This can be a problem if the form is linked to a membership, purchase, or other one-time action.
 This is why users cannot bookmark the results of a form submission if the method is POST.
